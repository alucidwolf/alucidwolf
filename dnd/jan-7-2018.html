    Intro: Just leaving great demon battle and acquisition of first piece to complete the power machine.

    Backstracking to town to speak with Galeman regarding what we experienced at the fight.

    Jesus the half-orc takes a rest(eric is away)

    The first piece, 4k farad capacitor was brought to Galemen, and is now dead from commiting suicide previously in the bunker.

    Crystal door stands in front of the group. A figure appears.

    It notifies us of a man we should visit at the tavern.

    We visit the tavern, a man questions the newcomer, Scruffy with a riddle.

    He answers wrongly, and Jesus smacks a bottle over the ruffians head and he is knocked out.

    A fight begins.

    Fight ends.

    Apparition appears and gives party members some advice and items.

    Zamorians ruined everything in a vision Scruffy saw at the river with Kustoff.
